Most of the time, our stakeholders (in this case, the CS:GO coaching staff) arenâ€™t tech-savvy
enough to run code themselves. Propose a solution to your product manager that:
    a. could allow our coaching staff to request or acquire the output themselves
    b. takes less than 1 weeks worth of work to implement

A very effective solution would be to build a simple website that provides drop down options 
for the specific filters they want to select (team_side, weapons, rounds, etc.). 
Develop heatmaps or well formatted output results for the coaches to easily view formatted 
results. The code for part a and b could be used in the background on the backend.

The website would also need to be able to gain access to the datasets since the coaches
would find it difficult to obtian the data and pass it into the website.
